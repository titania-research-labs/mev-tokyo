## Overview 📝

- MEV TOKYO is an Ethereum research house and event held in Tokyo. It focuses on exploring issues such as MEV, staking, and LVR.

- The research house will run from Aug 20 - 27, with side events taking place on the 25 and 26.

- Organized by [Titania Research](https://titaniaresear.ch/), it will bring together Ethereum researchers, engineers, and community members.

## Purpose 🧭

The aim of MEV TOKYO is to contribute to problem-solving in Ethereum by sharing practical insights and facilitating discussions on complex issues. By examining incentive problems from both protocol and application perspectives, we aim to create opportunities for new insights and realizations. We provide a space for emergent community discussions, promoting problem-solving to expand Ethereum as a free space for humanity.

## What We Are Not 🚧
- We don't prefer hosting large parties and strive to maintain the house as an intimate space where small groups can gather and enjoy meaningful conversations.
- The research house does not support team building. Please apply to ETH Tokyo individually. Even if you apply as a team, the entire team cannot participate together (each team member will be evaluated individually).
- Our house is not a hacker house, but a research house. It is not a place to work on projects, but a place to discuss and research Ethereum.

## Sponsorship 🤝

We are looking for sponsors to support the event. There are two sponsorship tiers:

1. $2,000
    - Opportunity to distribute your company's swag and flyers to attendees

2. $4,000
    - Ability to stay at the research house
    - Opportunity to distribute your company's swag and flyers to attendees
    - Opportunity for a lightning talk at the event
    - Invitations to private events with other speakers and sponsors

Now we are supported by Ethereum Foundation (ESP) and Mycel.
