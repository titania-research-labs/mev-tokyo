# MEV TOKYO ðŸ—¼ðŸš€

## Overview

- MEV TOKYO is an Ethereum hacker house and event held in Tokyo. It focuses on exploring issues such as MEV, staking, and LVR.

- The hacker house will run from August 21-28, with side events taking place on the 25th and 26th.

- Organized by Titania Research, it will bring together Ethereum researchers, engineers, and community members.

## Purpose

The aim of MEV TOKYO is to contribute to problem-solving in Ethereum by sharing practical insights and facilitating discussions on complex issues.
