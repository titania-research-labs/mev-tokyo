## What We Are Not 🚧
- We don't prefer hosting large parties and strive to maintain the house as an intimate space where small groups can gather and enjoy meaningful conversations.
- The research house does not support team building. Please apply to ETH Tokyo individually. Even if you apply as a team, the entire team cannot participate together (each team member will be evaluated individually).
- Our house is not a hacker house, but a research house. It is not a place to work on projects, but a place to discuss and research Ethereum.

## Sponsorship 🤝
